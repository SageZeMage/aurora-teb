    <description>
      <p>As a tundra dwarf, you are shaped by howling winds, frozen stone, and endless white horizons. Your people carve their halls into permafrost and glacier rock, relying on hard-won caution, patience, and the shared warmth of the clan to survive.</p>
      <p>If you’re a dwarf from the polar reaches or high frozen plateaus, you have this subrace, with the following traits.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong>
        Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Arctic Endurance.</em></strong>
        You have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you are naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Tundra Survivalist.</em></strong>
        You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. When you make a Wisdom (Survival) check related to tracking, navigating, or foraging in arctic or snowy environments, you can add double your proficiency bonus instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Surefooted on Ice.</em></strong>
        You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid being knocked prone or moved against your will while you are standing on ice or snow.
